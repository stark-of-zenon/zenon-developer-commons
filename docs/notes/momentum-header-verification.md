# Momentum Header Verification (Draft Notes)

A minimal description of how a browser-native client or lightweight sentry can verify chain progress without global state.

## Purpose of This Note

This document outlines the smallest viable mechanism for verifying Momentum headers in a resource-constrained environment (browser, mobile device, or minimal sentry node).

The goal is to define what a light participant needs in order to:

- confirm chain weight
- validate Pillar eligibility
- track account-chain finality
- enable zApps and local clients to operate without RPC gateways

This is not a full specification — only directional notes showing how header-level security fits into the broader architecture.

## 1. Why Header Verification Matters

A Zenon light node does not download global state.

Instead, it must independently verify:

- which Momentum chain has the highest valid weight
- whether the producing Pillar was eligible
- whether referenced account-chains can be considered finalized

Full nodes do this implicitly through execution.

Light nodes do it explicitly through headers + proofs, which is fully aligned with the whitepaper's minimal-data design.

Header verification is the backbone of:

- browser light clients
- hybrid sentry nodes
- cross-chain SPV integrations
- deterministic zApp commitments
- rapid bootstrapping without RPC servers

## 2. What a Header Must Prove

A valid Momentum header must allow a minimal node to answer three questions:

**(1) Was the Momentum produced by a valid Pillar?**

- verify Pillar signature
- verify the Pillar was active at that height
- verify eligibility under N&T

**(2) Does the header correctly link the chain?**

- previous hash
- height
- timestamp within allowed drift
- cumulative weight or scoring

**(3) Does the header commit to a valid set of account-chain references?**

- Merkle / hash commitments
- references to included transitions
- no need to execute the transitions

This lets clients treat the chain as cryptographically linked commitments rather than requiring full execution.

## 3. Minimal Verification Workflow

A lightweight client performs:

1. Download headers (sequential or batched)
2. Verify Pillar signatures
3. Check continuity and timestamps
4. Track cumulative weight to identify the best tip
5. Optionally request account-chain deltas on demand

This mirrors classical SPV patterns while preserving Zenon's dual-ledger semantics.

---

## 4. Why This Fits Zenon's Architecture

Zenon already anticipates minimal-resource participants:

- account-chains isolate state
- global ordering is compact
- PoW-links decentralize anti-spam
- deterministic zApps remove execution from consensus

Momentum header verification is the smallest trustless synchronization unit in the system.

Without it:

- browsers cannot act as peers
- sentries cannot filter or relay securely
- bridging cannot be trustless
- zApps cannot anchor deterministic outputs
- SPV is impossible

With it:

- any device becomes a peer
- no RPC gateways are required
- scaling moves to the network edge
- the dual-ledger architecture reaches its intended form

## 5. Open Questions

- What is the minimal header structure required for independent validation?
- How should cumulative weight be represented for light clients?
- What is the optimal commitment structure for account-chain references?
- What bandwidth constraints exist for browser-based syncing?
- Can header gossip run over WebRTC/libp2p without a specialized relay layer?

These are guidance questions for future work, not finalized decisions.
