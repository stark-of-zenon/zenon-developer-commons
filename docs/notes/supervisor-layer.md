Supervisor Layer — Research Draft

A Coordination Layer for Proof-First, Dual-Ledger Architectures

This document is conceptual and non-normative.
It outlines a potential intermediate verification role (“Supervisor Layer”) that can exist between Sentry nodes and Sentinel nodes in a deterministic, proof-first blockchain architecture such as Zenon’s dual-ledger model.



1. Introduction

Dual-ledger architectures separate local state evolution (account-chains) from global ordering (Momentum blocks). While this separation improves scalability, it introduces a structural gap:

	•	Sentries can generate many independent state transitions,

	•	Sentinels are responsible for validating and forwarding only structurally-sound transitions toward consensus,

…but without an intermediate layer, the system lacks:

	•	deterministic aggregation,

	•	fraud filtering,

	•	cross-transition dependency validation,

	•	and structured state-proof formation.

The Supervisor Layer is proposed as the missing coordination tier enabling scalable, proof-first execution without burdening Sentinels or Pillars.



2. Position in the Node Hierarchy

The architecture is organized into four conceptual layers:

Sentries

	•	Lightweight nodes (desktop, mobile, browser)

	•	Execute zApps locally

	•	Produce account-chain blocks

	•	Attach micro-PoW for spam resistance

Supervisors (Proposed Layer)

	•	Aggregate Sentry outputs

	•	Validate proof completeness

	•	Enforce deterministic ordering

	•	Construct compact State Proof Bundles

Sentinels

	•	Perform structural validation

	•	Filter malformed or adversarial transitions

	•	Prepare transitions for inclusion in Momentum ordering

Pillars

	•	Apply deterministic state deltas

	•	Produce and sign Momentum blocks

	•	Finalize global ordering

Supervisors create a shared intermediate representation between local execution and global verification.



3. Responsibilities of the Supervisor Layer

3.1 Proof Aggregation

Supervisors collect:

	•	account-chain block headers

	•	micro-PoW links

	•	zApp execution receipts

	•	dependency metadata

They consolidate these into verifiable State Proof Bundles suitable for light clients and Sentinels.



3.2 Deterministic Ordering

Supervisors enforce consistent ordering rules based on:

	•	timestamps

	•	dependency graphs

	•	difficulty thresholds

	•	execution ordering constraints

Any honest Supervisor should derive the same ordered bundle from the same Sentry inputs, ensuring global determinism.



3.3 Fraud Detection

Supervisors reject:

	•	invalid signatures

	•	malformed account-block structures

	•	duplicate or conflicting proofs

	•	missing inputs for zApp transitions

	•	insufficient or invalid micro-PoW

They serve as a local fraud-proof layer, reducing Sentinel workload and improving network hygiene.



3.4 QSR-Based Rate Governance

Supervisors use QSR-linked signals to regulate load:

	•	Excess Sentry activity → increased micro-PoW threshold

	•	Low Sentry throughput → reduced micro-PoW threshold

This creates a self-balancing, feeless rate-control mechanism without economic gas markets.



4. Interaction With zApps

Supervisors do not execute zApps.

Sentries execute deterministic zApp logic locally. Supervisors verify:

	•	execution receipts

	•	declared input/output commitments

	•	dependency satisfaction

	•	proof completeness

Thus, zApps resemble unikernel-style execution units producing concise state commitments.

Supervisors confirm those commitments are reproducible and safe to anchor upward.



5. Local → Global Convergence Model

Local Verification (Supervisor Level)

Each Supervisor maintains:

	•	recent Momentum windows

	•	local dependency graphs

	•	trust heuristics for Sentries

	•	partial views of zApp channels

Multiple Supervisors independently derive identical bundles from the same Sentry activity.

Global Verification (Sentinel Level)

Sentinels compare bundles:

	•	If multiple Supervisors converge → bundle accepted

	•	If bundles diverge → malformed or adversarial inputs rejected

This produces a naturally convergent verification tree without a global mempool or leader-driven block assembly.



6. Security Objectives

The Supervisor Layer must guarantee:

	•	Proof completeness — all dependencies included

	•	Proof correctness — signatures, PoW, receipts valid

	•	Deterministic output — verifiers derive identical bundles

	•	Fork resistance — no ambiguity when Sentinels compare bundles

	•	Scalability — Supervisor work remains local and parallel

This strengthens network integrity without increasing consensus overhead.



7. Browser-Native Implications

Supervisors produce compact bundles that browsers can:

	•	download via WebRTC/libp2p

	•	verify with WASM

	•	reconstruct deterministically

	•	store locally (IndexedDB, Service Workers)

This explains how a browser can function as a first-class light client without relying on RPC gateways or full nodes.

The Supervisor Layer, not Pillars, is responsible for packaging state into browser-friendly proofs.



8. Why the Supervisor Layer Matters

Supervisors resolve numerous open questions in dual-ledger architectures:

	•	How can Sentries scale horizontally without overwhelming Sentinels?

	•	How do zApps remain deterministic without global execution?

	•	How can state proofs become small enough for browser clients?

	•	How does the network maintain coherence without a mempool?

The Supervisor Layer is the organizing principle that makes the architecture modular, scalable, and verifiable.



9. Open Research Questions
    
	•	Should Supervisors be incentivized (e.g., via QSR rewards)?

	•	What cryptographic format should State Proof Bundles adopt?

	•	How many Supervisors are required for redundancy?

	•	How do Supervisors detect and penalize equivocation?

	•	Should Supervisors maintain partial state or remain stateless?

	•	What trust model is required between Supervisors and Sentinels?

	•	Can Supervisor logic be executed fully in WASM for portable deployment?

These questions define the research direction for maturing the Supervisor concept.



10. Summary

The Supervisor Layer provides:

	•	deterministic aggregation,

	•	fraud detection,

	•	proof bundling,

	•	rate control,

	•	and zApp validation between Sentries and Sentinels.

It explains how a proof-first system can scale to millions of lightweight Sentries—including browser clients—while preserving deterministic, low-cost global consensus.
