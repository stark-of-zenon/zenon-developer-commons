# Bounded Verification Series

A structured research series exploring verification primitives for the Zenon Network of Momentum. The documents build upon each other and should be read in order.

## Reading Order

1. **[Header-Only Verification](header-only-verification-research.md)** — foundational verification approach
2. **[Header-Only Verification — Hostile Review](header-only-verification-hostile-review.md)** — critical analysis
3. **[Bounded Inclusion](bounded_inclusion_without_merkle_README.md)** — inclusion proofs without full Merkle trees
4. **[Bounded Inclusion — Hostile Review](bounded-inclusion-hostile-review.md)** — critical analysis
5. **[Minimal State Frontier Verification](minimal-state-frontier-verification.md)** — lightweight state verification
6. **[Minimal State Frontier — Hostile Review](minimal-state-frontier-hostile-review.md)** — critical analysis

## Overview

This series progressively develops verification techniques that enable lightweight clients to validate Zenon state without requiring full node trust. Each document is paired with a hostile review that stress-tests the approach.
