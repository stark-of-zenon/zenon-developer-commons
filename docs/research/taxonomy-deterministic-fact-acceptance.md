Taxonomy Note: Deterministic Fact Acceptance

Research Note — Terminology & Classification

Purpose

This note clarifies the architectural category explored in this repository and distinguishes it from adjacent but non-equivalent blockchain models. Its goal is to reduce misclassification, not to assert novelty or superiority.

Core Term
Deterministic Fact Acceptance (DFA)

Definition:
A ledger model in which consensus admits state transitions based solely on deterministic verification of facts, while the computation or execution that produces those facts is local, discardable, and non-authoritative.

In a DFA model:

execution is permitted but never trusted

verification predicates are consensus-relevant

execution traces are not replayed globally

correctness is established without running foreign logic

What DFA Is Not

DFA is often conflated with existing categories due to shared primitives. These mappings are incorrect:

Not Smart Contract Platforms

Smart contracts require global execution or replay.

DFA systems do not execute application logic in consensus.

Determinism arises from structural predicates, not VM execution.

Not Light Clients

Light clients are clients of an execution chain.

DFA describes a ledger model itself, not a client optimization.

Not Stateless Clients

Stateless clients optimize state access.

DFA changes which computations are consensus-critical.

Not Rollups

Rollups execute off-chain but still require fraud/validity proofs tied to execution correctness.

DFA accepts facts without referencing execution traces at all.

Not Oracles or Bridges

Oracles introduce trust assumptions.

DFA relies only on cryptographic verification of supplied facts.

Canonical Comparison Axis

Most blockchains are classified by what is committed.
DFA is classified by what must be executed.

Dimension	Execution-Centric Chains	DFA Model
Execution	Global, authoritative	Local, non-authoritative
Verification	Implied by execution	Explicit predicate
Commitment	Execution outcome	Fact only
Failure Mode	Fork / consensus fault	Verification fails → no-op
Scalability Cost	Validator count × execution	Bounded verification only
Relationship to Known Systems
Bitcoin SPV

Bitcoin SPV is an instance of DFA applied to transaction inclusion.

DFA generalizes the pattern beyond Bitcoin.

Ethereum / Verkle / Statelessness

These optimize proof size and state access.

They do not remove execution from consensus.

Algorand State Proofs

Compress attestation of executed state.

Still rely on protocol-defined execution correctness.

Why DFA Is Easy to Misclassify

It uses familiar cryptographic tools (Merkle proofs, headers).

It removes an implicit assumption (global execution).

Most blockchain literature does not separate execution from acceptance.

As a result, readers often map DFA to the nearest known category (SPV, light clients) unless the distinction is made explicit.

Non-Goals of DFA

DFA does not attempt to:

prevent malicious software

verify user intent

sandbox arbitrary computation

provide general-purpose on-chain execution

It enforces outcome correctness, not behavioral guarantees.

Summary

Deterministic Fact Acceptance names a ledger-level responsibility split that is usually implicit or conflated:

Consensus verifies facts, not execution.

This taxonomy clarifies how systems can support interoperability, external verification, and scalable admission control without inheriting the costs of global execution.
