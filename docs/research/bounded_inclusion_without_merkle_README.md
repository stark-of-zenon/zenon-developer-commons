# Bounded Inclusion Research

This paper defines a bounded verification primitive for verifying local state against header-committed state roots.

## Scope Clarification

This paper does NOT propose:
- a consensus protocol
- a general-purpose light client
- global state verification
- canonical chain determination

The guarantees and non-guarantees are intentional and fundamental to the model.
