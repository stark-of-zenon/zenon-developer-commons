# DID & Applications Series

This research series explores decentralized identity and its applications on the Zenon Network of Momentum. The documents build upon each other and should be read in order.

---

## Reading Order

1. **[Decentralized Identity](decentralized-identity.md)** — foundational concepts for DID on Zenon
2. **[Encrypted Messenger](encrypted-messenger.md)** — builds directly on DID concepts
3. **[Bounded Verification DEX](bounded-verification-dex.md)** — applies bounded verification to decentralized exchange

---

## Overview

These research notes explore how decentralized identity primitives can enable new application patterns on Zenon, from secure messaging to trustless exchange verification.
