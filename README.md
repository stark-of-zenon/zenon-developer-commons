A public, community-driven space for exploring and documenting the technical
architecture of **Zenon — The Network of Momentum (NoM)**.

This repository serves as:

- a space for ongoing research into whether Zenon’s architecture can support a
  **browser-native, proof-verified light client** using technologies like WebRTC
  and libp2p  
- a neutral hub for engineering research  
- a place to organize architecture insights  
- a space to publish design notes, proposals, and analysis  
- a way for developers to collaborate without relying on chatrooms or politics  

The goal is simple:  
**Make Zenon’s deeper technical ideas easier to explore, discover, and understand.**

# ░░ Why This Repository Exists ░░

Zenon is an unconventional architecture combining:

- deterministic, VM-free contract interfaces  
- modular execution layers  
- dual-token economics  
- peer-to-peer communication primitives  
- concepts like Sentries, Pillars, and Accelerators  

However, much of Zenon’s design intent is:

- scattered  
- undocumented  
- buried in old chats  
- or never fully explained publicly  

This repository provides a structured place to collect, clarify, and refine that knowledge.

---

# ░░ What This Repository Is *Not* ░░

It is **not**:

- a governance tool  
- a decision-making authority  
- a replacement for core developers  
- a political or social channel  
- a roadmap for the ecosystem  

It *is* an **open research space** for technical thinkers who want to explore how Zenon works — or how it could evolve.

---

# ░░ Who This Is For ░░

This repository is intended for:

- protocol researchers  
- distributed systems engineers  
- blockchain architecture enthusiasts  
- P2P networking developers  
- cryptography and SPV-proof engineers  
- browser/WebRTC/libp2p developers  
- Zenon ecosystem contributors  
- curious readers with technical interest  

You *do not* need to be an expert to participate.
